# Museum of Photography Website
This project aimed to provide an opportunity to practice designing and implementing the front end of a website, focusing on showcasing a fictional photography museum. It serves as a platform to hone skills in front end development and design.

The project can be viewed [here](https://laurgu.github.io/SEG3125Project/). It is best viewed windowed (half screen) on a computer but can be viewed on any device with any window sizing.

## Technology Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Design Aspect
The design of the website is minimal, prioritizing the images on display rather than design elements of the website. It uses simple sans serif fonts and a limited color palette to achieve this. The design also prioritizes accecibility by using a high contrast palette that adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  

## Learning Outcomes
The project significantly enhanced familiarity with front end development inlcluding JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. It provided practival insights into creating an engaging and responsive web interface.

## Future Scope
- Improve scalability for various devises and window resizing
- Implement a backend system to manage and update the museums's content efficiently
